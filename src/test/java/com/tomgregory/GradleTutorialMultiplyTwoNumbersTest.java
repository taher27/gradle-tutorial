================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No explicit vulnerability
Issue: The provided code does not appear to have explicit security vulnerabilities. It is a simple multiplication method with no obvious security flaws.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two positive integers.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly multiplies two positive integers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two negative integers.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the method correctly multiplies two negative integers. The expected result is a positive number, as the product of two negative integers is always positive. This test validates the method's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyByZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly handles multiplication by zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up one integer and zero.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the integer and zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the method correctly returns zero when one of the numbers is zero. This is important as it checks the method's adherence to the mathematical rule that any number multiplied by zero is zero.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies large integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two large integers.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two large integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles and multiplies large integers. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle large numbers and potential integer overflow.
