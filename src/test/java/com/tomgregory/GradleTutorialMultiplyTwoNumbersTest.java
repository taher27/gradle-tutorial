================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No specific vulnerability found
Issue: The provided code is a simple multiplication function that doesn't seem to have any security vulnerabilities. It doesn't open any files, doesn't run any commands, doesn't connect to the internet, and doesn't use any third-party libraries.
Solution: No action needed

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication functionality for two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set two positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the set positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the multiplication of two positive numbers returns the correct result. This is significant in ensuring the basic arithmetic operation of the application is functioning correctly.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication functionality for two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set two negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the set negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the multiplication of two negative numbers returns a positive result. This is significant in ensuring the basic arithmetic operation of the application is functioning correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication functionality when one or both numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one or both numbers as zero.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the set numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the multiplication of any number with zero returns zero. This is significant in ensuring the basic arithmetic operation of the application is functioning correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for Mix of Negative and Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativePositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication functionality for a mix of negative and positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one number as positive and the other as negative.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the set numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the multiplication of a positive number and a negative number returns a negative result. This is significant in ensuring the basic arithmetic operation of the application is functioning correctly.
