ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=multiplyTwoNumbers_762727e6db

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: No security issues found in the provided code snippet. The function multiplyTwoNumbers(int a,int b) is a simple operation that does not involve any security risks such as data leakage, overflow, or third-party library usage.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies two positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive numbers as input.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with the two positive numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies two positive numbers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies two negative numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative numbers as input.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with the two negative numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies two negative numbers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies a number with zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide one number and zero as input.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with the number and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies a number with zero. The expected result is zero, as any number multiplied by zero is zero. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 4: Test for Multiplying a Positive and a Negative Number
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNegative
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies a positive and a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide one positive and one negative number as input.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with the positive and negative numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies a positive and a negative number. The expected result is a negative number, as a positive number multiplied by a negative number results in a negative number. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.
