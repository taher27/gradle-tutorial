ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=multiplyTwoNumbers_762727e6db

Scenario 1: Test to check multiplication of two positive numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when two positive numbers are multiplied. The target scenario is the multiplication of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two positive integers.
  Act: Invoke multiplyTwoNumbers method with two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is the correct multiplication of the two positive numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly multiplies two positive numbers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test to check multiplication of two negative numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when two negative numbers are multiplied. The target scenario is the multiplication of two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two negative integers.
  Act: Invoke multiplyTwoNumbers method with two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is a positive number.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly multiplies two negative numbers and returns a positive result. The expected result is the positive mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test to check multiplication of a positive number and zero

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfPositiveNumberAndZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when a positive number is multiplied by zero. The target scenario is the multiplication of a positive integer and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a positive integer and zero.
  Act: Invoke multiplyTwoNumbers method with a positive integer and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns zero when a number is multiplied by zero. The expected result is zero. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of zero.

Scenario 4: Test to check multiplication of a negative number and zero

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfNegativeNumberAndZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when a negative number is multiplied by zero. The target scenario is the multiplication of a negative integer and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a negative integer and zero.
  Act: Invoke multiplyTwoNumbers method with a negative integer and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns zero when a negative number is multiplied by zero. The expected result is zero. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of zero.

Scenario 5: Test to check multiplication of a positive and a negative number

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfPositiveAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when a positive number is multiplied by a negative number. The target scenario is the multiplication of a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Invoke multiplyTwoNumbers method with a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is a negative number.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly multiplies a positive number and a negative number and returns a negative result. The expected result is the negative mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of different sign numbers.
