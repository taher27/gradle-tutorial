ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=multiplyTwoNumbers_762727e6db

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No specific vulnerability found
Issue: The provided code is a simple multiplication function that doesn't seem to have any security vulnerabilities. It doesn't use any insecure Java features, third-party libraries, or unsafe runtime environment features.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies two positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies two positive numbers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies two negative numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies two negative numbers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly multiplies a number with zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide one integer and zero as input.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the integer and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully multiplies a number with zero. The expected result is zero, as any number multiplied by zero is zero. This test is significant for verifying the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can handle and correctly multiply large numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two large integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two large integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can successfully multiply large numbers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test is significant for verifying the scalability of the method.
