================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No specific vulnerability detected
Issue: The provided code is a simple multiplication function that doesn't seem to have any security vulnerabilities. It doesn't open any files, make network connections, or interact with any external systems or libraries.
Solution: No action required

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two positive integer values 'a' and 'b' are set up.
    Act: The multiplyTwoNumbers method is invoked with 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result matches the expected output of 'a' multiplied by 'b'.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly multiplies two positive integers. The expected result is based on the mathematical rule of multiplication.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two negative integer values 'a' and 'b' are set up.
    Act: The multiplyTwoNumbers method is invoked with 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result matches the expected output of 'a' multiplied by 'b'.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly multiplies two negative integers. The expected result is a positive number, according to the mathematical rule of multiplication.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyByZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method returns zero when one or both parameters are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: One or two zero integer values are set up.
    Act: The multiplyTwoNumbers method is invoked with the zero value(s) as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is zero.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles multiplication by zero. The expected result is zero, based on the mathematical rule that any number multiplied by zero equals zero.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly handles and multiplies large integer values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two large integer values 'a' and 'b' are set up.
    Act: The multiplyTwoNumbers method is invoked with 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result matches the expected output of 'a' multiplied by 'b'.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly multiplies large integer values. The expected result is based on the mathematical rule of multiplication. The test is significant to ensure the method can handle large numbers without overflow or errors.
