================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No specific vulnerability detected
Issue: The provided code is a simple multiplication function that doesn't seem to have any security vulnerabilities. It doesn't open any files, make network connections, or interact with any external systems or libraries.
Solution: No action required

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two positive integers.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly multiplies two positive integers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two negative integers.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the method correctly multiplies two negative integers. The expected result is a positive number, as the product of two negative integers is positive. This test validates if the method handles negative integers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyByZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly handles multiplication by zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up one integer and zero.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the integer and zero as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the method correctly handles multiplication by zero. The expected result is zero, as any number multiplied by zero is zero. This test validates if the method correctly implements this fundamental arithmetic rule.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testMultiplyLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the multiplyTwoNumbers method correctly multiplies large integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two large integers.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the two large integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles and multiplies large integers. The expected result is the mathematical product of the two numbers. This test validates if the method can handle large numbers without overflow errors.
