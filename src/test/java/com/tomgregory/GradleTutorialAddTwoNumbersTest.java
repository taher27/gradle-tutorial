================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: The provided code snippet is a simple method that adds two integers. It does not use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it is not subject to typical Java vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the sum of two positive integers. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the input values. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the sum of two negative integers. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the input values. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a zero and any integer as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the zero and the integer.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected sum of the integer and zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the sum when one of the input is zero. The expected result is the non-zero integer. This test is significant as it validates that the method can handle zero input.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Values

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles the addition of maximum integers, potentially resulting in an overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two maximum integer values as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two maximum integers.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected sum (which should be negative due to overflow).
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles integer overflow correctly. The expected result is a negative integer due to overflow. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle edge cases.
