ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive numbers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two positive numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. The expected result is based on the basic mathematical addition operation. The outcome of this test is significant to ensure the method performs correctly with positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative numbers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. The expected result is based on the basic mathematical addition operation. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a number and zero as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the number and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected sum of the number and zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds a number and zero. The expected result is the original number as the addition of zero does not change a number. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle zero as an input.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the method can handle and correctly add large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two large numbers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two large numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned result with the expected sum of the two large numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two large numbers. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle and correctly add large numbers, testing the robustness of the method.
