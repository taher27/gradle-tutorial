ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: This is a simple Java method that adds two integers. It doesn't use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it doesn't have any of the typical Java security vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized integers.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is the sum of the two integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. The expected result is the sum of the two integers. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles the addition of positive numbers correctly.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized integers.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is the sum of the two integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is the sum of the two integers. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles the addition of negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an integer and zero.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized integer and zero.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is the same as the initialized integer.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds an integer and zero. The expected result is the same as the initialized integer. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles the addition with zero correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Values

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly handles the addition of two maximum integer values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two integers with maximum integer values.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized integers.
    Assert: Anticipate an arithmetic overflow.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle arithmetic overflow. The expected result is an overflow error. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles the edge case of adding two maximum integer values.
