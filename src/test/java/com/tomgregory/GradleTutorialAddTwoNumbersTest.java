"""
Scenario 1: Add two positive numbers

Details:  
  TestName: addTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing two positive numbers as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with two positive numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the sum of two positive numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is a basic functionality test for the method.

Scenario 2: Add a positive number and a negative number

Details:  
  TestName: addPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing a positive number and a negative number as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with a positive number and a negative number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the difference between the positive and negative numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds a positive number and a negative number. This test is significant in checking the method's ability to handle different signs.

Scenario 3: Add two negative numbers

Details:  
  TestName: addTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing two negative numbers as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with two negative numbers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the sum of two negative numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. This test is significant in checking the method's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Add a number to zero

Details:  
  TestName: addNumberToZero
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing a number and zero as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with a number and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the same as the input number.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds a number to zero. This test is significant in checking the method's ability to handle zero-value parameters.

Scenario 5: Add two maximum integer values

Details:  
  TestName: addTwoMaxIntegers
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing two maximum integer values. This test is meant to check for integer overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with two maximum integer values.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an integer overflow occurs.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles integer overflow. This test is significant in checking the method's ability to handle edge cases.
