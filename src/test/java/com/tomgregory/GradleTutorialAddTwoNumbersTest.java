================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No specific vulnerability found
Issue: The provided code is a simple addition function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. There are no security issues regarding the built-in features, runtime environment, standard libraries or third-party libraries.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. The significance of this test is to ensure the basic addition functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. The significance of this test is to ensure the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a zero and another integer as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the zero and the other integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds a number and zero. The expected result is the other input number. The significance of this test is to ensure the method can handle zero as an input.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two large integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two large integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two large numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. The significance of this test is to ensure the method can handle large numbers.
