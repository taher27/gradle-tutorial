================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: The provided code snippet is a simple method that adds two integers. It does not use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it is not subject to typical Java vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it validates that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a number and zero as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the number and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the number when zero is added. The expected result is the number itself. This test is significant as it validates that the method can correctly handle the edge case of zero.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two large integers as input.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two large integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method accurately adds two large numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it validates that the method can handle large numbers without causing an overflow error.
