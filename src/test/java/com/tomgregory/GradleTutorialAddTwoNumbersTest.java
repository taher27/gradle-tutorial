================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: The provided code snippet is a simple method that adds two integers. It does not use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it is not subject to typical Java vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two positive numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the two numbers. This test validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two negative numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two negative numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the two numbers. This test validates that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive and a Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of a positive number and a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative number. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the two numbers. This test validates that the method can handle mixed sign numbers.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndNumber
  Description: This test will verify the addition of zero and a number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a zero and a number.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the number.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds zero and a number. The expected result is the number itself. This test validates that the method can handle zero as an input.

Scenario 5: Test Addition of Two Zeros

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoZeros
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two zeros. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two zeros.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two zeros.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds two zeros. The expected result is zero. This test validates that the method can handle zero as both inputs.
