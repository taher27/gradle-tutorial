ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: This is a simple Java method that adds two integers. It doesn't use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it doesn't have any typical Java-specific vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the sum returned by the method matches the expected sum.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the correct sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the sum returned by the method matches the expected sum.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the correct sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a zero and any other integer as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the zero and the other integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the sum returned by the method matches the expected sum.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly adds a number and zero. The expected result is the original number since adding zero to a number doesn't change its value. This test is important as it checks the method's handling of zero.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Value

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithMaxInteger
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly adds a number and the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide the maximum integer value and any other integer as input.
  Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the maximum integer value and the other integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the sum returned by the method matches the expected sum.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly adds a number and the maximum integer value. The expected result is the correct sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it tests the method's ability to handle the maximum integer value.
