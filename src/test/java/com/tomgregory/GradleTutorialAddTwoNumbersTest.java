ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: This is a simple Java method that adds two integers. It doesn't use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it doesn't have any of the typical Java security vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized integers.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is the sum of the two integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. This is a basic functionality of the method and needs to be tested to ensure correct operation.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized integers.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is the sum of the two integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an integer and zero.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized values.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is the same as the initialized integer.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds a number and zero. This is an edge case as adding zero should not change the original number.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Value

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly handles the addition of maximum integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two integers with the maximum integer value.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized values.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is correct or an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle the addition of maximum integers. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to handle extreme cases.

Scenario 5: Test for Minimum Integer Value

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMinIntegers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly handles the addition of minimum integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two integers with the minimum integer value.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the initialized values.
    Assert: Verify if the returned result is correct or an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle the addition of minimum integers. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to handle extreme cases.
