Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two positive integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. This test ensures the basic addition functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two negative integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. This test ensures the method can handle negative integers.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of Positive and Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with one positive and one negative integer.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the positive and negative integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer. This test ensures the method can handle mixed integers.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and Another Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndAnotherNumber
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds zero and another integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with zero and another integer.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the other integer.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds zero and another integer. This test ensures the method can handle zero as an input. 

Scenario 5: Test Addition of Maximum Integer Values

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntValues
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly handles the addition of maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with maximum integer values.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is as expected when adding maximum integer values.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the addition of maximum integer values. This test ensures the method can handle edge cases.
