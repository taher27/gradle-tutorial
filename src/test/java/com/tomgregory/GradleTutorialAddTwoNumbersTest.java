================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: The provided code snippet is a simple method that adds two integers. It does not use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it is not subject to typical Java vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two positive numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is a basic functionality test for the addTwoNumbers method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two negative numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two negative integers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. This is a basic functionality test for the addTwoNumbers method.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive and a Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of a positive and a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two integers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative number. This is a crucial test for the addTwoNumbers method as it checks for its ability to handle different signs.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndANumber
  Description: This test will verify the addition of zero and a number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a number.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two integers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the same as the number.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds zero to a number. This is a basic functionality test for the addTwoNumbers method.

Scenario 5: Test Addition of Two Zeros

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoZeros
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two zeros. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two zeros.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two zeros.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking that the method correctly adds two zeros. This is a basic functionality test for the addTwoNumbers method.
