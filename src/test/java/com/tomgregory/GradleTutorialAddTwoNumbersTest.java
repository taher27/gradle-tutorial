================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: No security issues found. The code provided is a simple addition function with primitive integer parameters.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two positive numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two positive numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is the basic functionality of the method and crucial for the application's calculations.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two negative numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the two negative numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. This verifies the method's ability to handle negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of Positive and Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify the addition of a positive number and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the positive and negative numbers.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the sum of the positive and negative numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative number. This verifies the method's ability to handle mixed sign numbers.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndNumber
  Description: This test will verify the addition of zero and a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and another integer.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with zero and the other number.
  Assert: Verify the returned result is the other number.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the method correctly adds zero to a number, which should result in the other number. This verifies the method's ability to handle zero correctly.

Scenario 5: Test Addition of Two Maximum Integers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's handling of the maximum limit of integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integers with the maximum possible integer values.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with these two max integers.
  Assert: Expect an arithmetic exception due to integer overflow.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the method's behavior when dealing with integer overflow. This test is significant in understanding the limitations of the method.
