================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: The provided code snippet is a simple method that adds two integers. It does not use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it is not subject to typical Java vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two positive integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. This is important to validate the basic addition functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two negative integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative integers. This is important to validate the basic addition functionality of the method.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of Positive and Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected result of adding a positive integer and a negative integer.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. This is important to validate the basic addition functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndANumber
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds zero and a number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with zero and a number.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the number, as adding zero to a number should result in the number itself.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds zero and a number. This is important to validate the basic addition functionality of the method.
