================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No specific vulnerability found
Issue: The provided code is a simple addition function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. There are no security issues regarding the built-in features, runtime environment, standard libraries or third-party libraries.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two positive integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the two integers. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two negative integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the two integers. This is significant as it validates that the method can handle negative integers.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive and a Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with one positive integer and one negative integer.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the positive and negative integer.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. The expected result is the mathematical sum of the two integers. This is significant as it validates that the method can handle mixed integers.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndNumber
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds zero to an integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with zero and another integer.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the other integer.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds zero to an integer. The expected result is the same as the other integer as anything added to zero equals the same number. This is significant as it validates that the method can handle zero as an input.
