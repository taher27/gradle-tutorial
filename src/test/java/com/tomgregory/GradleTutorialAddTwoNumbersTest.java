================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: The provided code snippet is a simple method that adds two integers. It does not use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it is not subject to typical Java vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities in this code snippet.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. The significance of this test is to ensure the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a number and zero as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the number and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the number when zero is added. The expected result is the number itself. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle zero as an input.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Value

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithMaxInteger
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly handles the addition of maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two maximum integer values as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two maximum integer values.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for an overflow.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle integer overflow. The expected result is an overflow error. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle edge cases. 

Scenario 5: Test for Minimum Integer Value

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithMinInteger
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly handles the addition of minimum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two minimum integer values as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two minimum integer values.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for an underflow.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle integer underflow. The expected result is an underflow error. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle edge cases.
