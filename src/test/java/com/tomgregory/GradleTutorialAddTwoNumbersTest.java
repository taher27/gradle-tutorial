Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two positive integers.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is the sum of the two positive integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two positive integers, according to basic arithmetic rules. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two negative integers.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is the sum of the two negative integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method successfully adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two negative integers, as per basic arithmetic rules. This test is crucial as it checks the method's functionality with negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an integer and zero.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the integer and zero.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is the same as the initialized integer.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method successfully adds a number and zero. The expected result is the initial integer, as adding zero to a number does not change its value. This test is significant as it checks the method's functionality with zero as an input.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly adds two maximum integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize two integers with the maximum integer value.
    Act: Call the method addTwoNumbers with the two maximum integers.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the sum of the two maximum integers.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method successfully adds two maximum integers. The expected result is the sum of the two maximum integers. This test is crucial as it checks the method's functionality at the limit of its input range.
