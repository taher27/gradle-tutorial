ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addTwoNumbers_da7966707b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: This is a simple Java method that adds two integers. It doesn't use any insecure Java features, runtime environment variables, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it doesn't have any typical Java-specific vulnerabilities.
Solution: No action needed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any external data or state.
  Act: Invoke addTwoNumbers with two positive integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. It's essential to ensure that the basic arithmetic operation is performed correctly.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any external data or state.
  Act: Invoke addTwoNumbers with two negative integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative integers. This is to cover the scenario of adding negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive and a Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any external data or state.
  Act: Invoke addTwoNumbers with one positive and one negative integer.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer. This is to cover the scenario of adding numbers of different signs.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Two Zeroes

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoZeroes
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any external data or state.
  Act: Invoke addTwoNumbers with two zeros.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two zeros. This is to cover the edge case of adding zero numbers. 

Scenario 5: Test Addition Resulting in Integer Overflow

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionResultingInOverflow
  Description: This test will verify that the method handles integer overflow correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any external data or state.
  Act: Invoke addTwoNumbers with two integers that their sum exceeds the maximum positive int value.
  Assert: The test should catch an ArithmeticException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles integer overflow. This is to cover the edge case of integer overflow.
