================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)
Issue: Although the submitted code snippet is quite simple and doesn't have obvious security issues, it's worth mentioning that in more complex functions, if there's an exception or error, the detailed error message shouldn't be exposed to the user, as it may leak sensitive system or application information.
Solution: Catch the exception and log the detailed error message for debugging purposes, but only show a general error message to the user.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Java System Libraries (CWE-749)
Issue: This code snippet is a simple addition function that doesn't use any Java system libraries. However, in a more complex Java program, the misuse of system libraries can introduce security vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution, data leakage, and denial of service.
Solution: Always use the latest version of Java and its libraries. Be cautious when using system libraries, especially those that can execute system commands, load dynamic libraries, or modify system configurations. Follow the principle of least privilege and avoid using system libraries if there are safer alternatives.

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190)
Issue: In this function, if the sum of a and b is larger than the maximum value that an int can hold, an integer overflow will occur, and the result will be incorrect.
Solution: Check if the sum of a and b is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE before performing the addition. If it is, throw an exception or return an error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two positive integer values 'a' and 'b' are set up.
    Act: The addTwoNumbers method is invoked with 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: The result is compared with the expected output.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the method accurately adds two positive numbers. The expected outcome is the sum of the inputs. This test is significant to ensure the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two negative integer values 'a' and 'b' are set up.
    Act: The addTwoNumbers method is invoked with 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: The result is compared with the expected output.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the method accurately adds two negative numbers. The expected outcome is the sum of the inputs. This test is necessary to ensure the method works properly with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive and a Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive number and a negative number. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: One positive and one negative integer values 'a' and 'b' are set up.
    Act: The addTwoNumbers method is invoked with 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: The result is compared with the expected output.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the method accurately adds a positive and a negative number. The expected outcome is the sum of the inputs. This test is needed to ensure the method works properly with mixed sign inputs.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndNumber
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds zero and a number. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Zero and an integer 'b' are set up.
    Act: The addTwoNumbers method is invoked with 0 and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: The result is compared with the expected output.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the method accurately adds zero and a number. The expected outcome is the value of the input number. This test is crucial to ensure that the method handles zero input correctly.
