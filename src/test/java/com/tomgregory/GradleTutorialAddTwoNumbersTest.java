"""
Scenario 1: Add two positive numbers

Details:  
  TestName: addTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing two positive numbers as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers by passing two positive numbers.
  Assert: Validate if the method returns the correct sum of the two positive numbers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method accurately adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers. This is important to validate the basic addition operation of the method.

Scenario 2: Add two negative numbers

Details:  
  TestName: addTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing two negative numbers as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers by passing two negative numbers.
  Assert: Validate if the method returns the correct sum of the two negative numbers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method accurately adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers. This is important to validate the basic addition operation of the method.

Scenario 3: Add a positive number and a negative number

Details:  
  TestName: addPositiveAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing a positive number and a negative number as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers by passing a positive number and a negative number.
  Assert: Validate if the method returns the correct sum of the positive number and negative number.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method accurately adds a positive number and a negative number. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers. This is important to verify that the method handles different signs correctly.

Scenario 4: Add zero to a number

Details:  
  TestName: addZeroToNumber
  Description: This test checks if the method addTwoNumbers returns the same number when zero is added to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers by passing a number and zero.
  Assert: Validate if the method returns the same number.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that adding zero to a number does not change the number. The expected result is the same number. This is important to ensure that the method handles the addition of zero correctly.

Scenario 5: Add two maximum integer values

Details:  
  TestName: addTwoMaxIntegers
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the method addTwoNumbers by passing two maximum integer values (Integer.MAX_VALUE) as parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers by passing two maximum integer values.
  Assert: Validate if the method returns the correct sum of the two maximum integer values.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method handles the addition of two maximum integer values correctly. The expected result would be an overflow of integer value. This is important to verify that the method handles integer overflow correctly.
