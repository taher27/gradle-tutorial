================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: N/A
Issue: The provided code does not appear to have any inherent security vulnerabilities. It is a simple method for adding two integers.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two positive integers as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integers as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method successfully adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two input numbers. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a number and zero as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the number and zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the number when zero is added. The expected result is the number itself. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of zero inputs.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Integer Values

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly handles the addition of maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two maximum integer values as input.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two maximum integer values.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for an overflow error.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method accurately handles integer overflow. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capabilities.
