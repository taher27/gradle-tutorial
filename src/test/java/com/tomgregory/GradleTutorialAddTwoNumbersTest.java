================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: This is a simple Java method that adds two integers. It doesn't use any insecure Java features, runtime environments, standard libraries, or third-party libraries. Therefore, it doesn't appear to have any security vulnerabilities.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two positive integers. 
  Assert: Compare the method's return value with the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. This test is essential to ensure that the basic arithmetic operation is performed correctly by the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method takes two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two negative integers. 
  Assert: Compare the method's return value with the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative integers. This test is important to ensure that the basic arithmetic operation is performed correctly by the method.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of Positive and Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Assert: Compare the method's return value with the expected sum of the positive integer and negative integer.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. This test is important to ensure that the basic arithmetic operation is performed correctly by the method.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Two Zeroes

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoZeroes
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two zeroes. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two zeroes. 
  Assert: Compare the method's return value with the expected sum of the two zeroes.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two zeroes. This test is significant to ensure that the basic arithmetic operation is performed correctly by the method.
