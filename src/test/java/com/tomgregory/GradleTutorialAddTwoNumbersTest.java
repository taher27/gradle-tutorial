Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two positive integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. The expected result is the correct sum of the two integers. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two negative integers.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is the correct sum of the two integers. This is significant as it validates that the method can handle negative integers.

Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive Number and a Negative Number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with one positive integer and one negative integer.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected result of adding a positive integer and a negative integer.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer. The expected result is the correct outcome of the operation. This is significant as it validates that the method can handle a mix of positive and negative integers.

Scenario 4: Test Addition of Two Zero Numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoZeros
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly handles the addition of two zeros. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method accepts two integers directly.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two zeros.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is zero.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly adds two zeros. The expected result is zero. This is significant as it validates that the method can handle the edge case of adding zeros.
