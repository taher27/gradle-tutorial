  Scenario 1: Positive Numbers Addition Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
    Description: This test is designed to validate the addition of two positive numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two positive integers for the test.
    Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two positive numbers. 
    Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of the two positive numbers.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is meant to verify that the method can correctly add two positive numbers. This is a basic functionality of the addTwoNumbers method and it's crucial for it to work correctly.

  Scenario 2: Negative Numbers Addition Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test is designed to validate the addition of two negative numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two negative integers for the test.
    Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative numbers.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of the two negative numbers.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. This is a critical functionality of the addTwoNumbers method as it should handle negative numbers correctly.

  Scenario 3: Zero Addition Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testAdditionWithZero
    Description: This test is designed to validate the addition of a number and zero. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a number and zero for the test.
    Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the number and zero.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the original number.
  Validation: 
    This assertion confirms that the method correctly adds a number and zero. This is a basic test to verify that the method handles zero correctly.

  Scenario 4: Large Numbers Addition Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testAdditionOfLargeNumbers
    Description: This test is designed to validate the addition of two large numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two large integers for the test.
    Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two large numbers.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of the two large numbers.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two large numbers. This test is important to ensure that the method can handle large numbers without overflow.

  Scenario 5: Small Numbers Addition Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testAdditionOfSmallNumbers
    Description: This test is designed to validate the addition of two small numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two small integers for the test.
    Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with the two small numbers.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of the two small numbers.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two small numbers. This test is important to ensure that the method can handle small numbers without underflow.
